## Running Tests

1. If not done already, create the python virtual environment (venv) with the command ``` python3 -m venv .venv ```
2. Activate the venv on Windows with ``` .venv/Scripts/Activate ```, or Linux and MacOS with ``` .venv/bin/activate ```
3. Run ``` python3 -m pytest ```. This will then run all tests, in all directories, with a file name starting with test.
